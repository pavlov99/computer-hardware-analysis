# Computer hardware analysis

When I decided to buy a MacBook, I realized that there are too many models now, each has a lot of configuration options and some of them are very pricy.
This repository consists of laptops hardware and pricing analysis. It sheds light on whether it makes sense to buy a top-notch laptop or moderate one with external GPUs.

### What is inside

* Crawled data from [cpu](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php) and [gpu](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu_list.php) benchmarks.
* MacBook hardware description (wiki: [MacBook Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro))
* Jupyer notebooks with analysis

### Quickstart

Install python3 and [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Makefile contains shortcuts, e.g. to start jupyter notebook run:

```
make notebook
```
